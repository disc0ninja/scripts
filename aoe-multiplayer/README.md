# AOE-MULTIPLAYER SCRIPT  
  
There were some issues getting aoe2de multiplayer working correctly. I found a solution on [https://protondb.com](https://protondb.com)
and have implemented them into a script for convenoence that can be run any time there's a patch.  
  
## Dependencies  
* The script relies on some cabextract tools that you may need to locate depending on your distro.
