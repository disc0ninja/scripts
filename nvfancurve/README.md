# nvfancuve  
  
Script that helps keep my 1080ti cool. For some reason the default settings never actually ramp the fan speed up
regardless of the temperature (at least not enough to keep the card from throttling). This script sets a more aggressive fan
curve by monitoring the temperature of the card and adjusting the speed based on settings in the script.  
  
Alternatively if you don't mind mind the noise you could just open nvidia-settings and lock the fan speed an any arbitrary percentage.
