# Scripts  
  
This repo is where I'll be saving my personal scripts.  
I'll be *trying* to keep a README along with each script (in it's respective directory). Look there first if you encounter any weirdness, or want more info.  
  
To use the scripts just clone the repo to a location on your $PATH, and run the scripts by dir name / name.  
  
Example adding to $PATH:  
```bash export PATH="/PATH/TO/REPO:$PATH ```  
  
Example running aoe-multiplayer:  
```bash aoe-multiplayer/aoe-multiplayer.sh ```
